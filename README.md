# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17

## OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Determining credit risk can present a challenge due the the nature of the business with the number of good loans far outweighing those that are risky. 

After learning a variety of techniques when working with imbalanced data, those skill are put to use to help a dear friend, Jill, determine a model that will most benefit the company going forward to evaluate credit risk.  The tools that will be utilized for this analysis are:
                * RandomOverSampler
                * SMOTE
                * ClusterCentroids
                * SMOTEENN
                * BalancedRandomForestClassifier
                * EasyEnsembleClassifier
Once the analysis is complete, we will wrap up the full presentation with a recommendation, or justification for no recommendation, based on the performance of the various models to predict credit risk. 


## RESULTS OF MODELS
##### RandomOverSampler

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
